# Tumor_size_prediction-linear_regression
The dataset appears to represent measurements and calculated metrics related to the analysis of tumors, possibly within a medical or biomedical research context. The goal of the dataset may involve understanding factors that influence tumor size or severity, potentially for predictive modeling or diagnostic purposes.

This dataset is likely used for medical research or predictive modeling of tumor characteristics, where understanding the relationships between different variables (such as mass, size, malignancy, and damage) can aid in diagnostics, treatment planning, or understanding the progression of the disease. The tumor_size variable could be the primary target variable for regression models aiming to predict tumor growth based on other factors.


All of this work was conducted for training purposes. My goal was to explore the applicability of linear regression for predicting tumor size within this dataset. However, despite various efforts, it became clear that this dataset is more suitable for classification tasks, and achieving good results with regression is unlikely. This was purely an exercise in experimentation and learning.
